# Analysis of CyrptoMarket
## **Project Name: Exploring Crypto Market data with a smart workflow**

**Project description:**
This project involves using Python to pull data on the cryptocurrency market from CoinMarketCapâ€™s API and then automating that process. Next, I take the data gathered and perform simple Data Analytics and Data Science techniques on the data gathered to generate visualization. The purpose of this project was for me to learn basic workflow skills and develop a written report on my findings.

## **Data set**
I pulled the data set used in this project through the CoinMarketCap API across 15 minutes and with 1-minute intervals between each pull.

## **Key Metrics used in analysis**
- **Timestamp**: The timestamp of the cryptocurrency data.
- **Time**: The extracted time (HH:MM:SS format) from the timestamp.
- **quote.USD.price**: The price of the cryptocurrency in USD.
- **quote.USD.market_cap**: The market capitalization of the cryptocurrency.
- **quote.USD.market_cap_dominance**: The dominance of the cryptocurrency in terms of market cap percentage.
